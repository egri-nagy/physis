The abstraction of the lifespace (topology, memory-model, accessing different subsets of organisms).

The topology can be arbitrary, the classic version is the 2-dimensional toroidal lattice with 8-neighbourhood.

The memory model can be cell-based - each organism is separate, and soup-like when they share one large memory array
(more interactions are possible)
